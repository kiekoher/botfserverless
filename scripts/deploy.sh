#   - doppler CLI
#   - docker & docker-compose
#   - npm
# ==============================================================================

# --- Helper Functions ---

# --- Pre-flight Checks ---

# Ensure Doppler is logged in. The CI/CD token should be set in the environment.

# --- Deployment Process ---
log "Starting deployment of EVA WhatsApp Gateway..."

# 1. Navigate to the project directory
# The script assumes it's being run from the project root directory.
# The GitHub Action should ensure it's in the correct location.

# 2. Pull latest changes from the main branch
log "Pulling latest code from 'main' branch..."
git checkout main # Ensure we are on the main branch
git pull origin main

# 3. Install/update Node.js dependencies
log "Installing/updating npm dependencies for the gateway..."
pushd services/whatsapp-gateway > /dev/null
npm install --production --omit=dev
popd > /dev/null # Go back to root

# 4. Deploy with Docker Compose and Doppler
log "Deploying services using docker-compose and Doppler secrets..."
# The `doppler run` command injects secrets into the environment.
# The `--` separates doppler's flags from the command to be executed.
# `up -d --build` will rebuild the image if the Dockerfile changed and restart the container.
if doppler run -- docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build; then
    log "‚úÖ Service deployed successfully."
else
    log "‚ùå Deployment failed. Check the logs from docker-compose."
    exit 1
fi

# 5. Optional: Clean up dangling Docker images to save space
log "Cleaning up old Docker images..."
docker image prune -f

log "üöÄ Deployment finished successfully!"
exit 0
