# EVA WHATSAPP GATEWAY DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT (V2 - Immutable Artifacts)
# ==============================================================================
# This script pulls a pre-built Docker image from a registry and deploys it.
# It is designed to be executed by the GitHub Actions workflow.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - doppler CLI
#   - docker & docker-compose
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (provided by CI/CD):
#   - DOPPLER_TOKEN: For logging into Doppler and the container registry.
#   - IMAGE_NAME: The full name of the image to pull (e.g., ghcr.io/owner/repo).
#   - IMAGE_TAG: The specific tag (e.g., commit SHA) of the image to pull.
# ==============================================================================
